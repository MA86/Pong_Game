# Pong Game

A simple prototype resembling classic Pong game. The purpose of this project is to learn low-level graphics/media technologies such as SDL2 and OpenGL. This project is part of a book that I'm currently reading (see below for book name).

## Technologies Used

Python and SDL2 (Simple Directmedia Layer) which is a low-level 3D game programming library similar to OpenGL.

## Demonstration

Coming Soon

Note: All source code for this game is inside `.py` files.

*The book I'm currently reading for this project is called, **Game Programming in C++: Creating 3D Games**.*
